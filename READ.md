# MyProject: A Next.js Web Application

## Project Description
MyProject is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and projects efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as organizing them into different projects. The application also includes features like task prioritization, due dates, and notifications to help users stay on top of their tasks.

## Key Features
- User-friendly interface for managing tasks and projects
- Task prioritization
- Due dates for tasks
- Notifications for upcoming tasks
- Integration with third-party services (e.g., email, calendar)

## Technology Stack
- Next.js: A React framework for building production-ready applications
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React DOM: A package that provides the DOM-specific implementations for React
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites
- Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library used for creating and displaying interactive 3D graphics

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyProject.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application

## Project Structure
- `app`: Contains the main application components, including `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, and the `api` subdirectory
- `components`: Houses reusable UI components, such as `grid.tsx`, `hero.tsx`, and `theme-provider.tsx`
- `data`: Contains JSON files, such as `confetti.json` and `globe.json`, which might be used as data sources for the application
- `lib`: Contains a shared utility file, `utils.ts`, which likely contains helper functions or constants used throughout the project
- `public`: Contains static assets, such as SVG files and images, which are served directly by the server without any server-side processing

## Notable Aspects
- TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.tsconfig.json` files) for type-checking and ensuring code quality
- PostCSS and Tailwind CSS for CSS processing and styling
- Sentry for error tracking and monitoring
- Well-organized `components` directory with subdirectories for specific UI components and reusable utilities
- Use of SVG files and images in the `public` directory
